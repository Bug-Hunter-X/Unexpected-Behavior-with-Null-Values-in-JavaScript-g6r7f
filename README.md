This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving null value handling and its solution.

The `bug.js` file shows the initial code with a potential issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents the improved version addressing the potential error.

The problem arises when checking for null values using strict equality. While effective for null, it fails to catch undefined. The solution utilizes loose equality, handling both null and undefined cases.
